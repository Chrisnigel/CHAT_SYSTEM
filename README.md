# CHAT_SYSTEM
TERMINAL BASED CHAT SYSTEM
It is the simple model based on python,without the GUI complexity,hence making it easier to understand.
Open terminal and run eg"python server.py"
Then open another terminal and run the second code eg"python client.py"
When prompted enter your nickname,click enter and then type your messsage.
To simulate a chat system open as many new terminal windows which will mimick the presence of many chat users in the sytem.
ENJOY!
